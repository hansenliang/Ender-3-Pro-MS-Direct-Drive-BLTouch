# Ender-3-Pro-MS-Direct-Drive-BLTouch

Use at your own risk. 

These files are provided to help other 3D printer enthusiasts set up their Ender 3 (Pro) with SKR Mini E3 + BLTouch sensor + Micro Swiss Direct Drive Kit + Micro Swiss All-metal Hotend. These configuration files should be used with Marlin 2.0.x: https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin

Your probe offsets will most likely differ. This is a baseline. PLEASE VERIFY SAFELY and update these values as needed for your particular machine. I used this mount: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4193449 with springs so your values will vary, even if you use the same mount.
